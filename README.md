# ðŸŽµ Spotify with AJAX (jQuery)

In this project, I've decided to practice making requests to a JSON using jQuery's AJAX. The JSON I created contains only a few artists, despite it requiring over 800 lines of code.

The program is very simple; when the page loads, it calls the JSON requesting only the artists (name, description, and image).
Once that request is loaded, we can select one of the artists, which will trigger another AJAX request, filtering for only that artist's albums.
Once that second request is completed, we can choose the album, which will call the JSON to return the songs from that album with their name, duration, and YouTube link.
When clicking on the albums, the container design will completely change, showing the album data at the top and the songs below.

## ðŸ“–â€ŠWhat I've Learned?
With this project, I've learned about making AJAX requests using jQuery, dealing with JSON data, and dynamically updating the user interface based on user interaction. I've also practiced using CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that changes based on user selections.
